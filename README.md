Basic workflows

### Important Text

Ctrl + K toggle to bold, italicize, and underline text. I use it for note taking.

### Lock Screen

Locks the screen and requires passcode to unlock

### New Finder Window

Opens a new finder window to my home directory

### Clear Clipboard

Clears clipboard, I use this with the lastpass workflow so I dont have passwords actively in my clipboard
