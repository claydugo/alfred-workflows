### Lock Screen

Locks the screen and requires passcode to unlock

### New Finder Window

`nf`
Opens a new finder window to my home directory

`proj`
Opens a new finder window to my projects directory

### Clear Clipboard

`clear`
Clears clipboard, I use this with the lastpass workflow so I dont have passwords actively in my clipboard

### Volume Control
